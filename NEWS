Changes in version 1.1
 - New features:
   - official binaries are now built with link-time optimization, stripped from
     debug symbols (reducing package size to about half) and also automatically
     tested on MacOS to actually work as expected.
   - `colorscreen autodetect` now works on stitched projects
   - make check` now executes unit tests and a testsuite for colorscreen
     features `colorscreen autodetect`, `colorscreen stitch`,
     `colorscreen render` and `colorscreen finetune`.
     Tests are run regularly on Ubuntu, MacOS Aarch64 and Windows x86 builbots.
   - `--enable-checking` configure option now enables extra runtime sanity
     checking.
   - tone curves are now saved to parameter files
 - Bugs fixed:
   - fixed text-mode progress info on Windows
   - Fixed problem with nested parallelism in finetune solver.
   - Stack size for Windows build was increased to avoid finetune solver crash
   - fixed `make examples`
   - fixed occasional crash when rendering Paget and Finlay plates in
     interpolated mode.
   - fixed bug in `colorscreen finetune --optimize-screen-channel-blur`
 - Internal changes:
   - cleaned up public API and privatized large part of libcolorscreen
     datastructures
   - automake buildsystem cleaned up and is now more standard.  As a
     consequence, build no longer defaults to `-O2 -g`.  We recommend to add
     `-Ofast -flto` into `CXXFLAGS` as documented in `README.md`.
   -  removed some now obsolette files from git (such as original presentation
      and low quality examples) from the git source tree

Version 1.0 was the first public release

Changes in version 1.1
 -  `make check` now executes unit tests and a testsuite for colorscreen
    features `colorscreen autodetect`, `colorscreen stitch`
    and `colorscreen render`
 -  removed some now obsolette items (such as original presentation and low
    quality examples) from the git source tree
 -  automake buildsystem cleaned up and is now more standard.  As a
    consequence, build not defaults to `-O2 -g`.  We recommend to add
    `-Ofast -flto` into `CXXFLAGS` as documented in `README.md`.
 -  official binaries are now built with link-time optimization, stripped from
    debug symbols (reducing package size to about half) and also automatically
    tested on MacOS to actually work as expected.
 -  fixed occasional crash when rendering Paget and Finlay plates in interpolated
    mode.
 -  fixed `make examples`
 -  `colorscreen autodetect` now works on stitched projects
 -  Stack size for Windows build was increased so finetune solver works
    (for unknown reason it works very slowly when run on real Windows; it is
    fast under wine). This is Issue #6
 -  `--enable-checking` configure option now enables extra runtime sanity
    checking
 -  fixed text-mode progress info on Windows
 -  cleaned up public API and privatized most of datastructures

Version 1.0 was the first public release

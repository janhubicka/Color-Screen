Changes in version 1.1
 - New features:
   - Support for new processes:
     - Dioptrichrome-B 
     - Improved Dioptrichrome-B
     - Warner-Powrie
     - Joly
   - New dye measurements
     - Thames, Dioptichrome and Autochrome dyes by Mees and Pledge (1910)
   - Support for RAW files from achromatic camera backs
   - Official binaries are now built with link-time optimization, stripped from
     debug symbols (reducing package size to about half) and also automatically
     tested on MacOS to actually work as expected.
   - MacOS binary has now fewer dependencies, so fewer permissions are needed to
     start it.
   - More effective parallelism while rendering files.
   - `colorscreen autodetect` now works on stitched projects.
   - Tone curves are now saved to parameter files.
   - `colorscreen` now support `--threads=n` parameter to control parallelism.
   - `colorscreen --help` is now organized into main section and independent 
     helps for every command
   - `colorscreen render` now support `--geometry` to specify whether output file
     should follow screen or scan geometry
   - `--disable-16bit-float` configure option now dsables use of more memory
     effecient but slower 16bit floats for temporary data
   - `colorscreen render --detect-geometry` and `colorscreen stitch` now allows
     specification of screen detection parameters
   - Significantly improved screen detection precision for scanners with
     moving sensors and/or lens (includuing phase one cameras that collect
     data sequentially from top to bottom).
   - Significantly faster lens warp solver
   - FFTW 3 library is now used for fast fourier transform and is significantly
     faster than previous implementation.
   - finetune now support finetuning of point spread function
     and sharpening parameters
   - `colorscreen analyze-scanner-blur` can now be used to produce scanner blur
     tables
   - profiling now works on stitched projects.
   - support for Sony RAW files
 - Infrastructure improvements:
   - `make check` now executes unit tests for
      - matrix implementation
      - color conversions
      - homography Random Sample Concensus (RANSAC) solver
      - lens warp correction solver
      - screen geometry discovery
     and also tests `colorscreen` commands:
      - `colorscreen autodetect`
      - `colorscreen stitch`
      - `colorscreen render`
      - `colorscreen finetune`
     Tests are run regularly on Ubuntu, MacOS Aarch64 and Windows x86 builbots.
   - `--enable-checking` configure option now enables extra runtime sanity
     checking.
   - `colorscreen --verbose-tasks` print all tasks performed.
 - Bugs fixed:
   - Fixed text-mode progress info on Windows.
   - Fixed problem with nested parallelism in finetune solver.
   - Stack size for Windows build was increased to avoid finetune solver crash
   - Fixed `make examples`.
   - Fixed occasional crash when rendering Paget and Finlay plates in
     interpolated mode.
   - Fixed bug in `colorscreen finetune --optimize-screen-channel-blur`.
   - Render images now contains less of unnecesary border along sides.
   - Fixed small triangles of missing mesh data on the corners of scan.
   - `colorscreen render --solver` now executes solver even if mesh is already
     present in parameter file.
   - Fixed crash with very small blur radius
 - Internal changes:
   - Cleaned up public API and privatized large part of libcolorscreen
     datastructures.
   - Automake buildsystem cleaned up and is now more standard.  As a
     consequence, build no longer defaults to `-O2 -g`.  We recommend to add
     `-Ofast -flto` into `CXXFLAGS` as documented in `README.md`.
   - Removed some obsolette files from git (such as original presentation
     and low quality examples) from the git source tree.
   - Library now uses namespace `colorscreen`

Version 1.0 was the first public release

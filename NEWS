Changes in version 1.1
 1. `make check` now executes unit tests and a testsuite for colorscreen
    features `colorscreen autodetect`, `colorscreen stitch`
    and `colorscreen render`
 2. removed some now obsolette items (such as original presentation and low
    quality examples) from the git source tree
 3. automake buildsystem cleaned up and is now more standard.  As a
    consequence, build not defaults to `-O2 -g`.  We recommend to add
    `-Ofast -flto` into `CXXFLAGS` as documented in `README.md`.
 4. official binaries are now built with link-time optimization, stripped from
    debug symbols (reducing package size to about half) and also automatically
    tested on MacOS to actually work as expected.
 5. fixed occasional crash when rendering Paget and Finlay plates in interpolated
    mode.
 6. fixed `makes examples`
 7. `colorscreen autodetect` now works on stitched projects
 8. Stack size for Windows build was increased so finetune solver works
    (for unknown reason it works very slowly when run on real Windows; it is
    fast under wine). This is Issue #6

Version 1.0 was the first public release

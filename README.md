An experimental tool to digitally attach viewing screens to scans of negatives for Finlay and Paget color processes.

The tool itself is rather quick hack made for 2013 exhibition of Sehctl and Vosecek museum of photography
  http://sechtl-vosecek.ucw.cz/en/
which displayed photographs from the Matson (G. Eric and Edith) Photograph
Collection digitized by Library of Congress.
  https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/matpc/colony.html
See the presentation.

The examples directory contains data for some aligned images and preview quality jpegs.  The original
scans are accessible here http://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?st=grid&co=matpc and can be retrieved according
to their number.  For example:
 http://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=00299&c=00299&st=grid&co=matpc&fi=number
Will find scan which corresponds to 00299u.par
